### Architecture solution

In this case, you can easyly provide any tests for this project.

# All changes

All related busines logic is on `service` modules. So each module can be tested separatly for each exchange.
Just one or mb two tasks in `tasks.py`, so test`s can be like in two lines of code, nothing fancy.
I dont get refactor models, becose i can undestand their purpose.
But in this case other developers or you can understand each line of code
